# medical-record

The Electronic Medical Record is a digital version of a paper chart that contains all of a patientâ€™s information and medical history and it is used for his diagnosis and treatment.
The data stored in the database can be created, managed and consulted only by authorized providers and staff from health care organizations.

This repository is part of a research project which took place in 2013 during my Bachelor of Science for the course *Health Information Systems*.
The technologies used for this part of the project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL and the supported actions are:
* Login in the system as a doctor
* Edit your personal details
* Add a new patient and some medical information about him
* Find a patient using his id
* Edit the patient's information
* Logout from the system

##### Unfortunately, this is only part of the initial project and the front-end solution is written in Greek language.
